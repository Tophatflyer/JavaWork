1. Given this fragment,
	class X {
		private int count;
	
		is the following fragment correct?
	class Y {
		public static void main(String args[]) {
			X ob = new X();
			ob.count = 10;

	No, ob.count cannot be directly accessed due to the access modifier for count in class X being private.

2. An access modifier must __________ a member’s declaration.

	An access modifier must come before a member's declaration

3. The complement of a queue is a stack. It uses first-in, last-out accessing and is often likened
to a stack of plates. The first plate put on the table is the last plate used. Create a stack
class called Stack that can hold characters. Call the methods that access the stack push( )
and pop( ). Allow the user to specify the size of the stack when it is created. Keep all other
members of the Stack class private. (Hint: You can use the Queue class as a model; just
change the way the data is accessed.)

//Chapter6Q3.java

4. Given this class,
class Test {
	int a;
	Test(int i){ 
		a = i; 
	}
}

write a method called swap( ) that exchanges the contents of the objects referred to by two
Test object references.

void swap(Test one, Test two){
	int temp = one.a;
	one.a = one.b;
	one.b = temp;
}


5. Is the following fragment correct?
class X {
 int meth(int a, int b) { ... }
 String meth(int a, int b) { ... }

 No, this following fragment is incorrect as you cannot distinguish methods on return type alone. In order to apply proper method overloading, the argument parameters must differ.

6. Write a recursive method that displays the contents of a string backwards.
	
	class Reverse{
		String word;
		Reverse(String str){
			word = str;
		}

		void reverse_string(int index){
			if(index != word.length()-1)
				reverse_string(index+1);
			System.out.println(word.charAt(index));
		}
	}

7. If all objects of a class need to share the same variable, how must you declare that variable?
	It must be declared static.

8. Why might you need to use a static block?
	Initialization of static variables in a class before object is created and for static methods with arguments.

9. What is an inner class?
	A non-static nested class

10. To make a member accessible by only other members of its class, what access modifier
must be used?
	private access modifier must be used.

11. The name of a method plus its parameter list constitutes the method’s _______________.
	signature

12. An int argument is passed to a method by using call-by-_______________.
	value

13. Create a varargs method called sum( ) that sums the int values passed to it. Have it return
the result. Demonstrate its use.

14. Can a varargs method be overloaded?

15. Show an example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.
