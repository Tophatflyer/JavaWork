CH3 NOTES

Input Characters From The Keyboard:
	System.in.read() returns an integer value and must be cast to a char if assigned to char variable.

If Statement:
	if(condition) statement;
	else statement;

	if(condition){
		statement sequence
	}else{
		statement sequence
	}

Switch Statement:
	switch(expression){
		case constant1:
			statement sequence
			break;
		case constant2:
			statement sequence
			break;
		.
		.
		.
		case constantN:
			statement sequence
			break;
		default:
			statement sequence
	}

For Loop:
	for(initialization; condition; iteration) statement;

	for(initialization; condition; iteration){
		statement sequence
	}

	Infinite For Loop:
		for(;;){

		}

While Loop:
	while(condition){
		statement sequence;
	}

Do-While Loop:
	do{
		statement sequence;
	}while(condition);

While vs. do-while Loop:
	Use do-while when at least one iteration is always expected. Otherwise use while loop.

Break:
	the break statement breaks out of the inner most loop.
	break label:
		in order to break out of a deeply nested set of loops

Continue:
	continue is the complement of break and forces the next iteration of a loop to take place
	continue label:
		in order to go to label just like break.
