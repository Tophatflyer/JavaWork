CH1 NOTES

JVM designed to interpret bytecode and execute it and allowed for portability of java to different platforms
JVM Encapsulates the Bytecode for security reasons

Three traits of java:

Encapsulation:
	Classes contain the attributes and methods of an object and are able to define the access of these objects wether they are public, protected, or private.
Polymorphism:
	Support of generic interfaces for classes that are used often with differing data types
Inheritance:
	One object acquired the properties of another object

Access Modifiers:
	Public:
	Protected:
	Private:

Static:
	Ex. public static void main(String args[])
		Static allows for the main() method to be called before an object of the class is created.

System.out:
	System.out is an object that encapsulates console output
