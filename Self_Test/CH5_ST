1. Show two ways to declare a one-dimensional array of 12 doubles.
	double [] a = new double[12];

	double a[];
	a = new double[12];

2. Show how to initialize a one-dimensional array of integers to the values 1 through 5.
	int Num = {1,2,3,4,5};

3. Write a program that uses an array to find the average of 10 double values. Use any 10 values you like.
//CH5Q3.java


4. Change the sort in Try This 5-1 so that it sorts an array of strings. Demonstrate that it
works.

5. What is the difference between the String methods indexOf( ) and lastIndexOf( )?

6. Since all strings are objects of type String, show how you can call the length( ) and charAt( )
methods on this string literal: "I like Java".

7. Expanding on the Encode cipher class, modify it so that it uses an eight-character string
as the key.

8. Can the bitwise operators be applied to the double type?

9. Show how this sequence can be rewritten using the ? operator.
if(x < 0) y = 10;
else y = 20;

10. In the following fragment, is the & a bitwise or logical operator? Why?
boolean a, b;
// ...
if(a & b) ...

11. Is it an error to overrun the end of an array? Is it an error to index an array with a negative value?

12. What is the unsigned right-shift operator?

13. Rewrite the MinMax class shown earlier in this chapter so that it uses a for-each style for loop.

14. Can the for loops that perform sorting in the Bubble class shown in Try This 5-1 be converted
into for-each style loops? If not, why not?

15. Can a String control a switch statement?
